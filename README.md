# Summary

Predict housing prices based on training set from Ames Housing dataset. 

## Method 
1. Data exploration 
2. Outlier handling
3. Log transform of sales price
4. Box Cox transformation for highly skewed variables
5. Feature engineering (creating new variables using linear relationship, one hot encoding)
6. Regression models (Lasso - best performance, Ridge, ElasticNet, GradientBoost)
7. Ensemble model with XGB + LightGBM
